I would suggest rewording to \"before itself returning\".  Or even drop mention of \"before returning itself\" entirely: unless otherwise stated, any documented behaviour can be assumed to occur before Upload returns.\n\nPutting it all together, my best overall suggestion is: \"Before sending an http request, Upload calls Hook to obtain a function which it subsequently calls with the http response.\"",
