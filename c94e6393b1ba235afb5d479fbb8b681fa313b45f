      "message": "\u003e are there restrictions on what types of things can go into this interface{}?\n\nThe spec ( http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-zyp-json-schema-03#section-5.1 ) says:\n\nany  Value MAY be of any type including null.\n\nI don\u0027t know if \"of any type\" means \"of any of the other simple types defined above\", but that\u0027s my guess.\n\n\u003e I wonder if we should make a new type...\n\nWe already support simple any types, which appear as type {}interface (see line 2290), and also arrays of any ([]{}interface). So if we were to introduce a new Any type, we\u0027d have to do it for those fields too, which would be a breaking change.  I\u0027m inclined not to go down that path.\n\nJust to be complete here, the generator \nalso supports \"map of string to array of any\", which would appear as map[string]interface{}(line 969). However, none of the Google APIs actually use this.\n\nRelatedly, we also have support for variant types, is basically a union type for schemas: e.g. GeoJsonGeometry in the mapsengine api.\n\nHowever, \"variants\" appear to be undocumented at https://developers.google.com/discovery/v1/type-format , and the only use of it (mapsengine) was recently turned down.  I\u0027m inclined to rip out variant support. The only impact I can see would be on anyone relying on this for endpoints.  But seeing as it\u0027s an undocumented feature, I\u0027m less worried about that.",
