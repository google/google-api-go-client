      "message": "I am worried about this approach for two reasons:\n\n1) we\u0027re making extra calls in the \"normal case\". IIUC, if the service usually responds with a full page of items, then we\u0027re doubling the cost of requesting a single page\n  1b) â€¦ and we\u0027re throwing away half the work that we\u0027ve done. It seems if we have to do this work, at least we should ask for a full page and re-use the results in subsequent NextPage calls\n\n2) we might slam a service that misbehaves. This implementation will hammer a service that incorrectly serves a large number of empty pages.",
