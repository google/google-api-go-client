      "message": "I don\u0027t think this approach is sound.\n\nIf the reader I hand to ObjectsInsertCall.Media returns a read error, then it\u0027s\ntrue that ObjectsInsertCall.Do will now return an error, via the out of band\nchannel. But the HTTP package will *not* see an error from the body you give\nit, and so it will go ahead and execute the request. Therefore a GCS object\nwill still be created with contents that I did not intend.\n\nYou need to find some way to plumb the media reader error into the HTTP request\nbody reader. (I am making the assumption here that net/http arranges for the\nserver to know that it shouldn\u0027t go ahead with the request if req.Body.Read\nreturns an error. I don\u0027t know enough about the details of HTTP to know if that\nis the case. bradfitz would know, of course.)",
