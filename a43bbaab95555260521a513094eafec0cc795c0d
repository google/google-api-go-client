      "message": "This implementation of a mono-test is inconsistent with how we are doing the rest of the tests, the edge case tests in interator_test.go. We are only testing the success cases in this mono-test. If we absolutely must test everything in one giant, exported test thing, don\u0027t you think we should test the edge cases in the same way?\n\nHowever, I personally do not like this mono-test approach.\nFor our own internal usage here, and for any external usage, I would actually prefer to see many discrete, explicit tests, rather than one giant, convoluted mono-test. Many smaller tests are 1) much easier to read as a supplement to documentation, and 2) much easier to debug when something goes wrong.\n\nWhat is the argument for having this testing functionality in one mono-test, rather than many smaller?",
