      "message": "This implementation of a mono-test is inconsistent with how we are doing the rest of the tests, the edge case tests in interator_test.go. We are only testing the success cases in this mono-test. If we absolutely must test everything in one giant, exported test thing, don\u0027t you think we should test the edge cases in the same way?\n\nHowever, I personally do not like this mono-test approach.\nFor our own internal usage here, and for any external usage, I would actually prefer to see many discrete, explicit tests, rather than one giant, convoluted mono-test. Many smaller tests are 1) much easier to read as a supplement to documentation, and 2) much easier to debug when something goes wrong.\n\nWhat is the argument for having this testing functionality in one mono-test, rather than many smaller?",

      "message": "This isn\u0027t technically a test function. It is really a utility function, meant to be called by the tests for each client that implements iterators. That is why it\u0027s in its own package. It\u0027s one-stop shopping: if you have an iterator, you can call this function to test it. We can break it into separate functions, but then the user would just have to call each one, for a less pleasant experience. Maybe there\u0027s a better design involving sub-tests, but we have to wait for 1.6 to go away before we could go there.\n\nTestNextWithNextPage and TestNextPageReflectionErrors don\u0027t need to live here. They only test code that lives in iterator.go. (Note that the code in this package partly exercises the code of iterator.go, but also will indirectly invoke the caller\u0027s underlying API, so it really tests that they\u0027ve implemented their iterator correctly.)",
